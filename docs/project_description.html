    <h1 id="purpose">Purpose of this document</h1>
    <p>
      This document describes an interactive map project for Crusader Kings II - a game running on Clausewitz engine, developed by Paradox Development Studio. The project is an exercise in reverse engineering, image processing, using Leaflet, and web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything you see is still work in progress, including this page.
    </p>

      Description of the game from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_Kings_II">Wikipedia</a>:

      <p>
	The game is a dynasty simulator where the player controls a Medieval dynasty from 1066 to 1453, though the DLC The Old Gods and Charlemagne allow for a start date of 867 and 769, respectively. Through the strategic use of war, marriages and assassinations among many other things, the player works to achieve success for his or her dynasty. The simulation is open-ended so the definition of 'success' is completely defined by the player.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      197 years between starting dates means quite radical changes on map. Petty kingdoms coalesce into mighty realms, vassals break free from their masters, nomadic tribes settle down and so on.

      For gameplay purposes the game map is divided into <strong>provinces</strong> (sometimes called &quot;counties&quot;). Player must (in general) directly control at least one province with her character. If the last province is lost, the game is over.

      As the game takes place in a feudal society, characters are ranked in a hierarchy. From lowest to highest, the playable ranks are count, duke, king and emperor. A character can hold multiple titles. Developers have included different map modes in a pre-game character selection screen, such as &quot;independent realms&quot;, &quot;counts&quot; and &quot;dukes&quot;. This allows, for example, a player to pick a powerful independent duke for an easy game.

      No medieval game would be complete without some depiction religion and culture. Western Eurasia was a tumultous part of the world, where Abrahamic religions <a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/Making-Europe-Robert-Bartlett/9780140154092">expanded</a> into new areas, Arabs invaded Iberian peninsula and Christians crusaded against Muslims. Therefore, provinces carry information about the current dominant culture and religion, which affect gameplay in various ways.

      As we can see, the game is loaded with a vast amount of information, and that players need easy ways to access it. Developers at Paradox have made a great job of including different map modes to the game. Furthermore, players have collected information to <a href="http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Crusader_Kings_II_Wiki">a wiki service</a>

      In November 2014 Paradox Interactive <a href="http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?817542-Announcing-the-launch-of-the-Offical-Paradox-Wiki-Service&s=b5a86e76fcc87551a1384274b3af7c53">announced</a> that it will take control of formerly community maintained wikis. As CKII Wiki was now part of official customer service, a forum user posted this message:

	OK, so this is a random request, but I think it would be a really great addition to the wiki that wouldn't be too much of a stretch for you guys to add since you're running it now. A fully interactive version of the in game maps that lets you switch between the various start dates, zoom in and out, switch map modes, etc. At the moment, it's really annoying how if I want to look at the name or shape of a province (say for posting and/or reading something on the subreddit for eu4) I have to spend the time opening the game (which on a crappy computer like mine takes a while) it would be super helpful if I could just access the map online!

	You wouldn't believe how complicated that is compared to the current functions of the wikis. Though it would be kind of awesome regardless, it isn't something that's simple to do.

      A few days later, I came across <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8649617">a thread</a> on Hacker News showcasing a Minecraft world that had been played for three and half years. The link in the opening post leads to a map of the world, made with <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>. As I checked out the tutorials, I got a feeling that an interactive map for the wiki might actually be something that I could do.
    </p>

    <h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
    <p>
      Leaflet supports drawing shapes from <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> files and accessing them easily, as <a href="http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth.html">this tutorial</a> shows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Map modding and game resources have been <a href="http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Map_modding">documented</a> extensively in the wiki, helping me greatly in forming the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      As stated before, the game map is divided into provinces. Shapes and locations of provinces are defined in a 3072 by 2048 <a href="http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Provinces.bmp">bitmap image</a>, where each of them has a unique colour. Colours are linked to ID-numbers and names in <a href="http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Definition.csv">definition.csv</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, my first problem was to turn this image
    </p>
    <a href="provinces_scaled.png"><img src="provinces_scaled.png" alt="Scaled image of provinces.bmp" width="600" height="400"/></a>
    <p>
      Into a collection of features in a GeoJSON-file, where each feature consists of a name, ID and a polygon defining the borders of a province. (Side note: some provinces are not connected components, so I should actually use a multipolygon)
    </p>
    <p>
      Polygons defined as an array of point pairs. Drawing them is simple - start from the first pair, draw a line to the second pair and so on. From the last pair a line is drawn to the first pair, thus completing the polygon. Therefore, if we want to define outlines of a province as a polygon, we need to get all points on the border in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      This requirement excludes using for example a flood fill to find border pixels. My solution is to use a variant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares">marching squares algorithm</a>, implemented in <a href="https://github.com/Lasokki/paradoxmap/blob/master/marcher/marcher.py">marcher.py</a>
    </p>

    <h1 id="todo">TODO</h1>
    <p>
      The project is not yet finished. Thus far, I have managed to create the GeoJSON, but it is merely a template. My next challenge is to collect data from various plaintext files that have been scattered in the game folder. This data includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Characters for each starting date and their vassal-liege -connections</li>
      <li>De jure titles</li>
      <li>Culture for each province</li>
      <li>Religion for each province</li>
      <li>Information about holdings in each province</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      And some other stuff. I also have to add controls to the map and greatly improve its visual appeal. This document is also work in progress, so I'll have to keep it updated.
